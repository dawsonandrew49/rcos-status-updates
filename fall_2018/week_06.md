## Last Week's Accomplishments
Upadated splash page js and css to have the "RushMe" look and
implemented a simple password checker. Added page after for fraternity updates.

## This Week's Plan
Connect website to s3 and read files containing fraternity info and rush event info.

## Anything Blocking?
Lots of hw/test for other classes

## Notes
Forgot to make update so this is what was going
on during that time.
