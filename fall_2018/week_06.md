## Last Week's Accomplishments
Upadated splash page js and css to have the "RushMe" look and
implemented a simple password checker. Added page that the site loads after
correct username and password is submitted.

## This Week's Plan
Connect website to s3 and read files containing
fraternity info and rush event info. Possibly implement editing this info if time
allows. Add more documentation and comments in my code/repo to explain what is
happening with the code.

## Anything Blocking?
Lots of hw/test for other classes last week, trying to make a big push this week.

## Notes
Forgot to make update so this is what was going
on during that time. Also I have been forgetting to push so I do not have a large
number of commits but they are usually above 50 lines each commit.
