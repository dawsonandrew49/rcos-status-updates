## Last Week's Accomplishments
connected Admin portal to the backend and can now get all data from events as well
as fraternity info. Added some dropdowns to help the user view and change the data.
Filled in the dynamo db with data from parser, updated parser code to write to db
instead of writing to a text file to speed this process up.

## This Week's Plan
Implement functionality to update dynamo db items using the admin portal.
Implement some more functionality on the frontend to show event data.

## Anything Blocking?
Home stretch for other classes but hopefully I can finish this soon.
