## Last Week's Accomplishments
Close to finishing frontend for the admin portal, deleting events now works,
and I am close to being able to add events, I will finish that some time tomorrow.
I also implemented a reload button to reload the current fraternity information
if the user wants to start fresh, and also implemented two buttons which allow
the user to decide to edit either the fraternity info or events.
(The 12th of Dec) I believe that once that is finished I will have
completed all of my semester goals. We deployed the backend on aws, we have launched
the app on the apple app store and I will have a completed admin portal sometime
tonight or tomorrow. I learned quite a bit about react through this project
and had a good semester working on RushMe. We gave a presentation that I was happy
with and I think Adam (the project founder) is satisfied with what I have produced.


## This Week's Plan
Finish last feature of admin portal and add a bit more documentation to the readme.

## Anything Blocking?
Home stretch for other classes but hopefully I can finish this soon.
