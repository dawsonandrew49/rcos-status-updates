## Last Week's Accomplishments
Finished frontend for fratrnity info editing. Dynamo db now is updated when the
user submits changes to the displayed information. Added a reset button to
allow the user to reload the page but stay on the same fraternity in case they
mess up editing data and want to reset it without reloading the entire website.
Starting to add validation checks to make sure users of the website do not make
mistakes.

## This Week's Plan
Implement some more functionality on the frontend to edit event data and delete
unneeded events. Also create two lambda functions to update s3 files. Also add
some more documentation

## Anything Blocking?
Home stretch for other classes but hopefully I can finish this soon.
