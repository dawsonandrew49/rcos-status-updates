## Last Week's Accomplishments
Wrote a lot of parsers for rushme data collection, wrote an image resizer
to generate thumbnail images for the app to load. Lots of clerical/logistical
work to get the app ready to launch on the app store.
Parsers take in data in a format which we sent to the ifc president.
Basically a very long csv file.

## This Week's Plan
Add password protection to Admin portal website and help Adam with any issues
facing the app before we submit to the app store.

## Anything Blocking?
Nothing blocking currently.

## Notes
No smallgroup last week so this is for week 3 and 4
